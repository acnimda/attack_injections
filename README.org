** TL:DR
Python Script for =sql= and =cmd= Injection Attacks.

  - For SQL Injection:
#+begin_src bash
python3 attack.py sql http://example.com

#+end_src

  - For Command Injection:
    #+begin_src bash
    python3 attack.py cmd /path/to/script.sh
    #+end_src

** overview

This script is designed to perform two types of injection attacks:
- SQL injection;
- command injection.

It's a tool that allows the user to specify the type of attack and the target via the command line. The script is structured to be user-friendly and efficient in demonstrating these two common security vulnerabilities.

The tool is designed to perform both =sql= and =Command Injection attacks=. It offers two modes of operation: SQL Injection (=sql=) and Command Injection (=cmd=), which can be selected based on the command line arguments.

** Requirements
  - =Python3=
  - Python libraries: =requests=, =subprocess=.

** Usage
*** SQL Injection Attack:
Use this command to perform an *SQL injection attack* on a specified URL.
#+begin_src bash
python3 attack.py sql <URL>
#+end_src


Replace =<URL>= with the *target URL*.

*** Command Injection Attack:
Use this command for a *command injection attack* with a specified script path.

#+begin_src bash
python3 attack.py cmd <SCRIPT_PATH>
#+end_src
Replace =<SCRIPT_PATH>= with the path to the target backup script.

** Script explained :mortar_board:
*** sql_injection_attack(base_url)
*Purpose:* Performs an SQL injection attack.
Parameters:
- =base_url=: The URL where the SQL injection will be attempted.
*Working:*
- Iteratively tests each character in the specified range to find a match using time-based SQL injection method.
- Concatenates each successful character to form a word (e.g., database name or sensitive data).
*** command_injection_attack(backup_script)
*Purpose:* Executes a command injection attack.
*Parameters:*
- =backup_script=: The path to the target backup script vulnerable to command injection.
*Working:*
- Tries to find the correct password by appending characters to the existing string and checking the output.
- Continues until the correct password is found.
*** main()
*Purpose:* Acts as the entry point of the script.
*Working:*
- Parses command-line arguments for attack type and target (URL or script path).
- Calls the appropriate function based on the selected attack type.
